in modern software development ,ci/cd pipelines automate the process of building ,testing and deploying applications
managing different states and transitions within such a pipeline can be intricate and error-prone
the state design is ideal for encapsulating the state specific behaviour of a pipeline

Pipelined States:
1.Queued state
2.Building state
3.Testing state
4.Packaging state
5.Deploying state
6.Monitoring state 
7.Completed state
8.Failed state
9.Cancelled state

each state defines how the pipeline behaves when certain actions are invoked
